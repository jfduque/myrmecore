# MyrmeCore

MyrmeCore is a web based, centralized, WSN (wireless sensor network) management tool that provides data storage, device control, realtime status & analysis

## Â¿How does it works?
MyrmeCore is a web application. It means that it runs on a webserver and requires a web browser to use. Sensor measurements are wirelessly transmitted through the network to a gateway node, which inserts them into a database.

Subsequently, users perform queries and analysis using software tools from the graphical user interface. Users can also give orders to the WSN and check its status.
